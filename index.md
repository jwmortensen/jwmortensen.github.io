I am a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Simon Fraser University. Currently, I work with <a href="http://www.lukebornn.com/">Luke Bornn</a> developing statistical methods for high dimensional spatiotemporal data in order to better understand problems related to basketball and other sports. Previously, I conducted research in environmental spatial statistics with <a href="https://mheaton.byu.edu/">Matt Heaton</a> while completing my MS in statistics at BYU.
