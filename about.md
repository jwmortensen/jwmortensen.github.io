Hi, I'm Jacob Mortensen.

![Graduation Picture](/assets/article_images/about/graduation.JPG)

I am a graduate student in the Department of Statistics at Brigham Young University, currently 
studying the spatial and temporal effects of environmental heat on mortality and other health outcomes. 
Previously I have researched intergenerational poverty and gender differences in education.

When not studying I enjoy riding my bike, camping, and hiking with my family.
