Although R has some fairly advanced graphics capabilities, when it comes to mapping
spatial data there are some alternatives that can produce much more detailed
and visually appealing graphics. One such alternative is [Mapbox][1], an organization
that provides a variety of very useful and beautifully designed mapping tools. In this post I will show
how data can be exported from R, connected to a shapefile using [QGIS][2], then styled
and mapped using Mapbox.

## Data

## Converting grid points into a grid cell shape file

## Connecting data with shapefile

## Using Mapbox Studio to style data

## Adding data to an existing map
